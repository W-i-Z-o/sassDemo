# ePortfolio: SASS / SCSS, Simon Knab, TINF15B4

Hello everybody,


this week (31.05.2017) I will do my ePortfolie about SASS/SCSS.

You can find the slides here: https://github.com/W-i-Z-o/sassDemo/blob/master/SASS.pdf

If you want to contribute in the demo you have to prepare two steps:

Install SASS like it is described here: http://sass-lang.com/install

I recommend the command line way!


Create a new folder and copy the following file into it

Have fun!
